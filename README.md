Project 501

The goal of this project is to create a cool little star wars game.

The initial idea is to create a game similar to risk in that the objective is to conquer the galaxy as a whole. Here are
some of the features that I hope to impliment in the game.

FEATURES:
    - The ability to choose your faction/time period
    - The ability to unlock/purchase different troop types
    - The ability to choose which troops are used in battles
    - In the same vein as the last feature, certain troops perform better on certain planets i.e.
      AT-ATs are very benefitial on planets like Hoth and very ineffective on planets like Kamino.
    - Space battles.

This will probably take some time but I think it can be fun and we'll have a pretty impressive game to show when it's done.
